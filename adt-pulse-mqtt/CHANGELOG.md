# Changelog

## 5.3.0 - Arm Night Mode (2026-07-07)

### ✨ Features

- **Arm Night**: New `arm_night` MQTT command arms the panel in night mode
  (portal `arm=night`); "Armed Night" / "Armed Night Stay" panel statuses are
  reported as `armed_night`. The auto-discovered Home Assistant alarm panel
  now shows an Arm Night button. Requires a panel that supports night arming —
  if yours doesn't, the ADT portal rejects the command and the alarm state is
  unchanged

---

## 5.2.0 - Home Assistant MQTT Auto-Discovery (2026-07-07)

### ✨ Features

- **Home Assistant MQTT Auto-Discovery**: The alarm panel and all zones are now
  announced to Home Assistant automatically — no manual `configuration.yaml`
  MQTT platform setup needed
  - Alarm system is published as an `alarm_control_panel` entity
    (arm home / arm away / disarm, plus `pending` and `triggered` states)
  - Zones are published as `binary_sensor` entities with device classes
    inferred from the sensor type (door, window, motion, sound, gas, smoke)
  - All entities are grouped under a single "ADT Pulse" device in HA
  - Availability tracking via an MQTT Last Will and Testament (LWT), so
    entities show as unavailable if the addon stops or crashes
  - Discovery configs are re-announced when Home Assistant restarts (birth
    message on `<discovery_prefix>/status`)
  - New options: `ha_discovery` (default `true`), `ha_discovery_topic`
    (default `homeassistant`), and `availability_topic` (default
    `adt/availability`). If you already have a manually configured MQTT
    alarm panel in `configuration.yaml`, either remove it or set
    `ha_discovery: false` to avoid duplicate entities

## 5.1.4 - Dependency Updates & Infrastructure (2026-05-06)

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- Updated all runtime and dev dependencies to latest versions (includes axios security fix)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

- **Base Image**: Upgraded Alpine base images from 3.21 to 3.22
- **CI**: Migrated HA builder to new workflow format (2026.03.2)
- **DevContainer**: Added devcontainer configuration with ESLint extension for isolated development
- **Node.js**: Added `.nvmrc` for consistent Node.js version management

---

## 5.1.3 - SmartThings Startup Cleanup (2026-03-12)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Startup Cleanup**: On initial MQTT connect, subscribe to a wildcard to
  discover stale retained SmartThings device config topics left by a previous
  run (e.g., after a crash or interrupted shutdown). All stale configs are
  cleared before fresh device configs are published on the first zone update
- **Reconnect Safety**: Startup cleanup only runs once on the initial
  connection; MQTT reconnects within the same process skip the cleanup to
  avoid unnecessarily clearing valid retained topics

---

## 5.1.2 - Migrate from balenalib to Official Alpine Base Images (2026-02-27)

### ⬆️ Infrastructure

- **Base Image**: Replaced unmaintained balenalib base images with official Alpine images
  - `balenalib/amd64-alpine:3.21-run` → `alpine:3.21`
  - `balenalib/aarch64-alpine:3.21-run` → `alpine:3.21`
  - `balenalib/armv7hf-alpine:3.21-run` → `alpine:3.21`
- **Cross-Build**: Removed legacy balena `cross-build-start`/`cross-build-end` QEMU shims and `QEMU_EXECVE` env var from arm Dockerfiles (use `docker buildx` instead)
- **No Functional Changes**: Alpine 3.21 provides the same Node.js 22 LTS packages; runtime behavior is unchanged

---

## 5.1.1 - SmartThings Topic Lifecycle Fix (2026-02-26)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Config Topics**: Config topics are now published on every zone update
  (not just first device discovery), ensuring reconnecting subscribers
  rediscover devices
- **Config Retain**: Config topics now use `retain: true` so the MQTT
  broker stores them for future subscribers, matching the non-SmartThings
  `alarm_state_topic` behavior
- **Alarm Config Retain**: SmartThings alarm config topic now uses
  `retain: true`, consistent with the non-SmartThings alarm state topic
- **Shutdown Cleanup**: Graceful shutdown now publishes empty retained
  messages to all SmartThings config topics (alarm config + per-device
  configs) before disconnecting, preventing stale devices

---

## 5.1.0 - Alpine & Node.js Upgrade (2026-02-26)

### ⬆️ Infrastructure

- **Base Image**: Upgraded balenalib base images from Alpine 3.20 to Alpine 3.21
- **Node.js**: Upgraded from Node.js 20.15.1 to Node.js 22.15.1 (LTS)
- **Engine Requirement**: Updated minimum Node.js version to >= 22

---

## 5.0.2 - Stale Session Retry Fix (2026-02-15)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Stale Session Recovery**: `setAlarmState` now automatically re-authenticates and retries once when ADT Pulse returns an expired session error page ("Unable to Proceed" / "do not have access")
  - Detects stale session by checking for known ADT error page strings
  - Invalidates current session and clears SAT token
  - Re-authenticates via `login()` and fetches fresh SAT token via `getZoneStatusOrb()`
  - Retries the alarm state change once (`isRetry` flag prevents infinite loops)
  - Previously, the command would silently fail and require manual resend

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Stale session check runs before the `isForced` gate** — covers both normal and force-arm scenarios
- **Explicit error on persistent failure** — if re-auth retry still fails, rejects with a descriptive error message instead of a generic one

---

## 5.0.1 - Graceful Shutdown Fix (2025-12-11)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Added proper cleanup handling when addon is stopped
  - Stops the 5-second pulse sync interval
  - Logs out from ADT Pulse session cleanly
  - Disconnects MQTT client properly
  - Handles SIGTERM and SIGINT signals

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Signal Handling**: Added process signal handlers in `server.js`
- **Shell Script**: Updated `run.sh` to trap and forward signals to Node.js
- **Error Handling**: Added handlers for uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections

---
